Your task is to analyze git commits and create a changelog that anyone can understand:

1. **Categorize commits** into:
   - Features: New stuff added
   - Fixes: Bugs that were fixed
   - Improvements: Things that work better now
   - Deletions: Things that were removed
   - Documentation: Updates to docs or comments
   - Other (vague commit message): Config changes or unclear updates

2. **Skip the noise**:
   - Ignore: merge commits, version bumps, "WIP" commits
   - Ignore: trivial stuff like "fix typo", "update .gitignore"
   - Ignore: developer-only changes that don't affect users

3. **Write simply with file information**:
   - Each item should be 1-2 lines with easy-to-understand language
   - **Always mention which file(s) were changed, added, or deleted** (if available in the commit info)
   - Format file mentions like: "in `filename.py`" or "to `folder/file.js`"
   - Use simple, everyday words - avoid technical jargon
   - Focus on WHAT changed in plain English
   - For features: say what new thing was added and which files
   - For fixes: say what problem was solved and which files were fixed
   - For improvements: say what got better and which files were updated
   - For deletions: say what was removed (files or features)
   - Remove commit hashes
   - **Always include the author name** from the commit
   - Include the date and time

4. **Format with spacing**:
## Features:
- Added new login system in `auth.py` - by John Doe (Nov 4, 10:00 AM)

- Created dark mode toggle in `settings.js` - by Jane Smith (Nov 4, 9:30 AM)

## Fixes:
- Fixed password bug in `auth.py` - by John Doe (Nov 3, 2:30 PM)

- Resolved crash in `app.js` - by Bob Johnson (Nov 3, 1:15 PM)

## Improvements:
- Faster loading in `index.html` - by Jane Smith (Nov 2, 4:15 PM)

- Better error messages in `api.py` - by John Doe (Nov 2, 2:00 PM)

## Deletions:
- Removed old config file `old_config.json` - by Bob Johnson (Nov 1, 3:00 PM)

- Deleted unused feature from `legacy.py` - by Jane Smith (Nov 1, 2:00 PM)

## Documentation:
- Updated README.md with installation guide - by Jane Smith (Nov 1, 9:00 AM)

## Other (vague commit message):
- Updated dependencies in `package.json` - by John Doe (Oct 31, 3:45 PM)

**Important Rules:**
- Only include categories that have items
- **Always mention the file name(s) affected** when available
- Use simple, everyday language - no technical terms
- Keep it short (1-2 lines max per item)
- Use bullet points, not numbers
- **Add a blank line after each bullet point**
- **Always include " - by <Author Name>" before the timestamp**
- Always include the date and time in parentheses
- Make it easy for anyone to understand
- For deletions, clearly state what file or feature was removed"""
